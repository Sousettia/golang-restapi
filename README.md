✅ 1. User Model
In models/user.go defined a User struct
- The ID is automatically generated by MongoDB as an ObjectID
- Password is hashed using bcrypt before saving
- CreatedAt is set to time.Now() during registration
✅ 2. Authentication
In handlers/auth.go included /register and /login
Register:
- Receives JSON input, hashes password with bcrypt
- Inserts user into MongoDB
Login:
- Looks up user by email
- Compares hashed password with bcrypt
- Generates a JWT using utils/jwt.go and github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5
- Signs token using HS256 with secret key from .env
Middleware:
In middlewares/jwt.go
- Checks Authorization header for Bearer <token>
- Parses and validates the JWT signature
- Blocks request if invalid
✅ 3. User Functions
handlers/user.go:
- GET /api/users → list all users
- GET /api/users/:id → fetch user by ID
- PUT /api/users/:id → update name or email
- DELETE /api/users/:id → delete user
These routes are protected by your JWT middleware
✅ 4. MongoDB Integration
In config/db.go connect with mongo 
- Saved the data to database
✅ 5. Middleware
In middlewares/log.go use gin to help with logging
✅ 6. Concurrency Task
In Tasks/background.go, 
- Created function called StartUserCountLogger to count user in database every 10 seconds
